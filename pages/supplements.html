        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>Supplements can be a great way to enhance your gym experience
            and also speed up progress in the gym. For me personally, I 
            have experimented with three supplements...protein powder, 
            pre-workout, and creatine. I have varying opinions on each, so,
            on this page, I will go through my thoughts on each of the three
            supplements that I have tried.
        </p>
        <h2>Protein Powder</h2>
        <p id="protein_powder_paragraph">Protein powder is a supplement that gives you a big dose of
            protein in a quick-to-consume fashion. I have tried numerous 
            different protein powders and my opinion on all of them is the same. 
            Protein powder can be a great thing, especially when you are trying 
            to hit a certain protein goal per day, but overall they aren&apos;t
            necessary. Protein powder is just that, protein, and you can meet all
            of your protein goals easily if you are paying close attention to 
            what you eat and making smart decisions. Protein powder isn&apos;t bad, as
            it can be a little boost to hitting your goals, but all of the people 
            who say you need to use it are wrong. So, my opinion on protein powder 
            is essentially, use it if you want, if not it doesn&apos;t really matter.
            Personally, I will use a protein shake whenever I feel I need one, but
            it isn&apos;t something that I use heavily.</p>

        <h2>Pre-Workout</h2>
        <p id="pre-workout_paragraph">Pre-workout is something that I have a little
            less experience with. I&apos;ve tried dedicated pre-workout powders and
            energy drinks, but I&apos;ve never really felt the need to use pre-workout
            except in rare situations where I&apos;m just doing it for fun. 
            Pre-workout is essentially just a cocktail of various ingredients, the main 
            one usually being caffeine, and although it can give you a little extra energy,
            it really isn&apos;t something that you need, and isn&apos;t even something that 
            I would recommend, as drinking copious amounts of caffeine all the time is 
            pretty bad for your health. So, in my opinion, pre-workout isn&apos;t something
            I would personally recommend.</p>

        <h2>Creatine</h2>
        <p id="creatine_paragraph">Creatine is the supplement that I probably have the most experience with. I 
            used creatine every single day over a period of about 7 months. A creatine 
            supplement is essentially either a powder or pill that contains creatine, which
            is something that you typically intake from things like red meat and seafood. 
            When you take creatine as a supplement, the cells in your muscles essentially
            produce more energy during lifting. While on creatine I did notice I was able
            to lift more weight and do so for longer. Additionally, my muscles looked a lot
            fuller, but this is in part due to creatine causing your muscle cells to hold more
            water. Overall, I really did see great benefits to using creatine, but I stopped
            for a few reasons. One is that when on creatine, your body gets dehydrated a lot
            easier, so you have to drink a ton of water, and for me personally, I strangely
            noticed that using creatine caused me to have a lot more acne than usual, and there 
            is anecdotal evidence to suggest that creatine could exacerbate acne. So, due
            to these reasons as well as the cost of having to constantly purchase creatine,
            I stopped using it. My recommendation is to try creatine out and see if you like
            the results you are getting from it, and then make a decision based on that.</p>
