    <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>There are many people that have inspired me throughout my
            weightlifting journey. There are people that have personally
            impacted how I approach weightlifting, as well as a few famous
            bodybuilders that have inspired me to better myself.</p>
        <h2>Cameron Nice</h2>
        <p id="cameron_paragraph">Cameron Nice, one of my closest friends that I&apos;ve known for a majority
            of my life, has been a large inspiration for me personally as I
            pursue weightlifting. Cameron was the friend that initially invited me 
            to try going to the gym, and although he started a little bit before me, 
            we both have gone through essentially the same type of journey on roughly 
            the same timeline. We have been each other&apos;s greatest motivators in the gym, 
            constantly sharing new workouts, tricks, diet ideas, etc. with each other, as 
            well as encouraging each other in difficult situations that arise in our 
            journeys. So, huge shout out to Cameron.</p>

        <h2>CBUM</h2>
        <p>CBUM, or Chris Bumstead, is arguably the most prevalent bodybuilder on 
            the current scene. Seeing all of his amazing accomplishments in bodybuilding
            has inspired me to want to improve myself physically. Additionally, watching his 
            social media content and learning various techniques and exercises from it
            has proven to be very beneficial in my personal journey, changing the way
            I approach the gym in a variety of ways. CBUM has probably been the biggest
            influence that I&apos;ve had in regard to people that I haven&apos;t personally met.</p>

        <h2>Joey Swoll</h2>
        <p>Joey Sergo, professionally known as Joey Swoll, has had a huge impact on getting
            me to go to the gym. Joey Swoll has a very large social media prevalence and is
            known primarily for spreading positivity in the gym. He works to encourage people
            to show kindness and support to gym goers of all different experience levels. 
            Before going to the gym myself, I was nervous that I would be out of place in the 
            gym, or that there would be a sense of unworthiness. However, people like Joey Swoll
            taught me that when it comes to the gym, we&apos;re all at different levels, and 
            that&apos;s perfectly fine. He taught me to be comfortable with where I&apos;m at
            while still encouraging me to strive to engage in self-improvement. The work that 
            Joey Swoll does is amazing and I fully support what he does for the gym community.</p>
