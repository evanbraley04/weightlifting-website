    <h1>Why Dieting is Crucial to Weightlifting</h1>
        <p>Dieting is crucial to making progress in the gym, but not in 
            the way you might expect. When you lift, there are essentially
            three main things you can do with your weight. You can cut to
            lose weight, maintain your current weight, or bulk to gain weight.
            If you are trying to lose fat and slim out, a cut might be the
            best thing for you to do. If you are trying to maintain your current
            physique and maybe get a little more defined, then maintenance is
            probably the way to go. If you are trying to build a large amount
            of muscle mass in a relatively short period of time, a bulk is 
            the best option. These three options essentially rely on the amount
            of calories that you intake daily. Your body has something known as 
            a TDEE, or total daily energy expenditure, which essentially equates 
            to how many calories your body burns in a day. Thus, depending on what 
            your goals are, you need to eat an amount relative to your TDEE in order 
            to fluctuate your weight. This is the most important component of dieting 
            for bodybuilding. In addition to this, you want your protein intake to be
            pretty high, about one gram per lb that you weigh. Protein plays a large part 
            in building muscle so you want to make sure you are eating enough of it. 
            In regards to eating healthy, or eating certain foods, that isn&apos;t really a 
            large component of dieting in concern to bodybuilding. Obviously eating healthy 
            foods is better, and will lead you to having a healthier body overall, but
            there isn&apos;t a magical formula or certain foods that you can or can&apos;t eat. 
            Overall, dieting, when it comes to bodybuilding, is all about fluctuating your 
            weight in order to meet your various goals, while also ensuring a good intake 
            of protein in order to ensure muscle building.</p>
        <h2>My experience with dieting</h2>
        <p id="my_diet_experience_paragraph">I&apos;ve made some mistakes in the past with dieting. When I first started lifting 
            I had no idea what I was doing and just kind of ate. This was detrimental to
            making progress and it wasn&apos;t until I started paying closer attention to dieting 
            that I started to make noticeable progress. For me personally, I started in a 
            place where I was very underweight, so my initial goal was to put on lots of mass. 
            I did this by going on a &quot;bulk&quot;. Essentially, I just ate significantly more
            than before. I found a website that helped calculate my TDEE, which for me I found to
            be roughly 2,800 calories per day when accounting for the amount of physical activity I 
            was doing everyday. I started by first adjusting to eating at my maintenance. Before 
            I was eating significantly under my maintenance, which was probably a large contributor 
            to me being underweight. Once I got used to that, I slowly upped my intake overtime, to 
            the point where roughly a year later I was eating 4,000 calories per day. One of the most 
            important tools that I have found for staying on track with my diet has been a dedicated 
            food tracker app. I personally used FoodNoms, which can be found on the appstore. An app 
            like this helps ensure that you are meeting your goals everyday, which is important
            because it is extremely easy to overestimate or underestimate how much you are really eating.
            For me personally, I am still currently bulking as I haven&apos;t reached a point yet where I feel 
            I need to start losing weight. My current plan is to continue my bulk until I reach roughly
            160 lbs and then reassess from there. Throughout my journey with dieting I&apos;ve come to the
            realization that although dieting isn&apos;t really complex per se, it is entirely individual and 
            personal. What works for some people, may not work for others, so it is important to 
            experiment and grow to figure out what helps you personally achieve the progress that suits 
            your goals.
