        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>When you go to the gym six times a week over a prolonged period
            of time, setbacks are bound to happen. Over my time in the gym 
            I have faced injuries, sickness, lack of motivation, and loads of
            other things that have kept me out of the gym. Below you will find 
            my experiences with all of these.
        </p>
        <h2>Injuries</h2>
        <p>During my time in the gym I have gone through various injuries. These
            have caused setbacks in my progress and have overall been a pain. 
            The first major injury that caused a substantial amount of time
            out of the gym was my wisdom teeth removal surgery. My recovery 
            from the surgery took longer than the typical person and I was unable
            to strain or lift for three weeks after. Since then I&apos;ve had two 
            other injuries including a sprained wrist and a sprained ankle. 
            Unfortunately, these occurred right after one another, so I was 
            completely out of the gym for over a month. Once back in the gym I
            still had to take it very easy for weeks after as to avoid rekindling 
            my injuries. All of these injuries caused very large decreases in my 
            physique and strength and overall were very unfortunate. However, I will
            say that even when you take an extended period off from the gym, your 
            progress returns within a few weeks. Muscles have a way of rebuilding a
            lot faster than it originally took to build the muscle in the first 
            place. Due to this, although injuries are awful and you should take 
            precautions to avoid them, they aren&apos;t the end of the world, 
            and you can bounce back in no time.</p><br>

        <h2>Failing to Diet Properly</h2>
        <p>Diet plays a huge role in your progress in the gym. If you haven&apos;t 
            already, you should check out my dieting page, which can be found in 
            the link section below. Regardless, it can be hard to meet your daily
            goals that you might have for your diet. It might feel impossible for 
            you to eat more than you already have, or you might not feel like cooking,
            or you might have a busy day and fitting all of your meals in may not feel 
            plausible, or a plethora of other reasons. I have dealt with many reasons 
            why I can&apos;t follow my diet well and it can definitely be a hurdle to your 
            progress in the gym. My advice if you are struggling with following a diet 
            would be to not completely change your diet all at once, as this can cause 
            problems in how you adjust to that, but rather slowly make changes overtime 
            that fit your needs and abilities. This will allow you to progressively
            get closer to your goal diet, while still being able to make progress 
            along the way.</p>
        <h2>Life Getting in the Way</h2>
        <p>The gym takes up a lot of time. Between extreme diets, actually going to 
            the gym, driving to and from, showering and such afterwards, and everything 
            else, it can be hard to fit it into a busy schedule. Life gets in the way of 
            the gym all of the time, not to mention a lack of motivation, tiredness, or 
            when you get sick and physically can&apos;t. I deal with all of these on a weekly 
            basis, and my advice is...if you physically can go to the gym, go to the gym. 
            Although it can be a pain in the moment, if you consistently skip days, you 
            won&apos;t progress very much and it will take you a lot longer to reach your goals.
            Obviously situations arise where you can&apos;t go to the gym, and in those cases you&apos;ll 
            be fine, but try to make it a priority to follow your gym routine to the very 
            best of your ability.</p>
        <h2>The Struggle of Working Out with Friends</h2>
        <p>Throughout my time in the gym I have worked out alone and also with friends. 
            Although going with friends can be a blast, it can also prove to be challenging. 
            For starters scheduling workouts with your friends can be a nightmare, and can 
            significantly add to all of the difficulties described in the previous paragraph. 
            On top of all this, conflicts can arise when discussing which muscle groups to 
            hit, or which exercises should be in the workout. My advice here would be to use 
            your best judgment. If working out with your friends is proving to be more 
            challenging than benefical, you might as well just go by yourself as weightlifting
            is all about self-betterment anyway. I will say for myself personally, I love working 
            out with friends and try to work with mine to make sure we can workout together 
            reasonably often.</p>
