        <h1>My Background</h1>
        <p>My whole life, I was very skinny. I ran cross-country 
            and track, and didn&apos;t eat a whole lot. Before
            I started working out, I was 115 lbs at 5&apos; 7&quot;
            tall. Around April of 2021, one of my best friends
            who was training for football, asked me if I
            wanted to go to the gym with him. I thought it
            would be a fun way to maybe get healthier, but it
            ended up opening the door to one of the most
            exhilirating hobbies I have. From that day on, I became
            viciously motivated and hungry for weighlifting.
            I started lifting 6 days a week, monitoring my
            calories, and centering my days around the gym.
            It became an obsession. Over the course of a year
            I had gained over 30 lbs and looked completely different.
            Over the past year and a half, I have tried many
            different techniques, and learned many things about
            weightlifting and how to transform your body. 
            My goal with this website is to inform you about
            how I did this, and how it changed my life for
            the better!</p>
