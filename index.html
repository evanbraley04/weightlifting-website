        <h2>A Little About Me...</h2>
        <p>Hello, my name is Evan Braley. I am currently
            a freshman computer science student at the
            College of Engineering &amp; Physical Sciences
            at the University of New Hamshire. I am from a
            small town on the Seacoast of New Hampshire. I
            enjoy various hobbies, such as drawing, playing
            guitar, and of course, the subject of this website,
            weightlifting.</p>
        <h2>Why I Have Created This Website</h2>
        <p>To start off, the main reason why I have created
            this website is because it is an assignment for my
            IT 403 class. Making this website is helping me
            explore the process of creating, editing, and
            reviewing HTML and CSS documents in order to create a functioning
            website. However, that doesn&apos;t diminish the secondary
            purpose of this website, which is to educate you
            about my journey in weightlifting, and also to provide
            some helpful tips and tricks that you may be able to
            incorporate into your own journey!</p>
        <p id="greeting">I hope you all enjoy my website and learn tons about how you can better
            improve your health and wellness through physical activity.</p>
